- title: Core functions used to get data from Wikidata as data frames
  contents:
  - tw_get
  - tw_get_property
  - tw_get_qualifiers
  - tw_get_p_wide
- title: Core functions that return character vectors of the same length as input
  desc: These are commonly used with piped operations.
  contents:
  - tw_get_label
  - tw_get_description
  - tw_get_property_same_length
  - tw_get_p1
  - tw_get_property_label
  - tw_get_property_description
- title: Labelling
  desc: Besides the dedicated functions for labelling, `tw_label()` attempts to turn
    Q identifiers to labels in data frames such as the ones generated by the core
    functions listed above.
  contents: tw_label
- title: Filters
  desc: These are convenience functions; the result is similar to using `tw_get()`
    and `dplyr::filter()`, but with less typing.
  contents: starts_with("tw_filter")
- title: Functions to interact with Wikidata via Wikipedia
  contents: starts_with("tw_get_wikipedia")
- title: Search Wikidata
  contents:
  - starts_with("tw_search")
  - tw_query
  - tw_get_all_with_p
- title: Function to retrieve *all* information available in Wikidata, as a list
  desc: Mostly used internally, but exported as it may be relevant to deal with edge cases or for troubleshoothing.
  - tw_get_item
- title: Retrieve information about images
  desc: Since images are not stored within Wikidata, but often relevant to those working
    with Wikidata, these functions wrap relevant APIs to facilitate getting data about
    images associated with a Wikidata Q identifier
  contents: starts_with("tw_get_image")
- title: Functions to retrieve more detailed data that are not (yet) cached by `tidywikidatar`
  contents:
  - tw_get_property_with_details
  - tw_query
- title: Cache settings
  contents:
  - tw_create_cache_folder
  - tw_enable_cache
  - tw_disable_cache
  - tw_set_cache_db
  - tw_set_cache_folder
- title: Other settings
  desc: Set options for the current session
  contents:
  - tw_set_language
  - tw_set_user_agent
- title: Functions for resetting the cache
  desc: After upgrading to a new `tidywikidatar` version, or in the unlikely case
    of database corruption, these can be used to delete specific cache tables. Consider
    deleting the whole cache if these do not help.
  contents: starts_with("tw_reset_")
- title: Functions used internally for dealing with cache
  desc: They are exported for easier access to advanced users, but should be disregarded
    by most.
  contents:
  - tw_connect_to_cache
  - tw_check_cache
  - tw_check_cache_folder
  - tw_check_cached_items
  - tw_disconnect_from_cache
  - tw_check_cache_index
  - tw_index_cache_search
  - tw_index_cache_item
  - starts_with("tw_get_cache")
  - starts_with("tw_write_")
- title: Functions used internally to check for validity of data
  desc: They are exported for easier access to advanced users, but should be disregarded
    by most.
  contents:
  - tw_check_qid
  - tw_check_pid
  - tw_check_search
- title: Extractors
  desc: These functions are mostly used internally to extract selected data to an
    object previously downloaded with `WikidataR`
  contents:
  - starts_with("tw_extract_")
  - tw_get_field
- title: Functions made to process only inputs of length one, used internally
  desc: The user can safely rely on the correspondent core functions, these have been
    created separetely mostly for testing and code structure.
  contents: ends_with("_single")
- title: Reference data frames
  desc: These are empty data frames (with zero rows), mostly used internally when
    a function does not have relevant results to return. They can also serve as reference
    data frames to know what to expect from a given function or as placeholders.
  contents: starts_with("tw_empty_")
- title: Example datasets
  desc: Just a couple of datasets with a bunch of Wikidata Q identifiers to be used
    for examples or testing
  contents:
  - starts_with("tw_qid_")
  - tw_test_items
